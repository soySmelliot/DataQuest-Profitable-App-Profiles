This leads me to believe that a reader app for a popular (potentially religious) public domain work could be a good app profile to explore that may work in both the Android and Apple market spaces. We may want to add functionality like word search, definitions, notes, bookmarks, discussion forums etc. to help stand out in the crowd. \n",
